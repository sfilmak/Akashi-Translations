# Akashi Translations
**Hello!**

If you want to help me translate Akashi to more languages or fix mistakes in existing ones - you are welcome to do so!

Just open pull requests to fix translation in the existing language or submit the translation in a new language. Don't forget to write which language it is.

You can always notify me directly about new translation here to speed up the process:
- **https://t.me/akashi_app** Or here: **https://www.reddit.com/r/akashi_app/**

**Download Akashi**: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sfilmak.expenses.tracker

Of course, I will add you to the app credits.

**Thank you very much in advance!**
